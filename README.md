*Datasets*
This is the directory that includes all of our data sets.

Our final clean datasets are in this directory.

*00_requirements.R*
This file includes all libraries necessary for the project.

*01_funct_DataCleaning.R*
Here we include all functions necessary for the data cleaning.

*02_func_Plots.r*
Here we can find all functions necessary for data plotting.

*21_DataProcessing.Rmd*
Here we can find our data processing file. In this, we read all the data sets from the dataset directory, read them into our R environment, transform them as necessary, and join them all together into a single dataset.

*22_DataCleaning.Rmd*
In this file, we take the merged dataset from 21_DataProcessing.Rmd and clean it even further. Then we upload the clean data set into processed_data.
